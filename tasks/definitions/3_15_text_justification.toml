[task.description]
text = """
Implement full text justification. Given a list of words and a maximum line width,
format the text such that each line has exactly `max_width` characters and is
fully (left and right) justified.

Implement the function:

`fn justify(words: &[&str], max_width: usize) -> Vec<String>`

Rules:
1. Pack as many words as you can in each line. A line's word count is determined
   greedily: add words to the current line as long as adding the next word (plus
   one space separator) does not exceed `max_width`.
2. Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the
   number of spaces does not divide evenly, the leftmost gaps get one extra space
   each. For example, if a line has 3 gaps and 7 extra spaces, the gaps get
   3, 2, 2 spaces respectively.
3. The last line of text should be left-justified with no extra spacing between
   words. Pad the end of the last line with spaces to reach `max_width`.
4. A line containing only one word should be left-justified and padded with
   trailing spaces.

You may assume all words have length ≤ `max_width` and that the input is
non-empty.
